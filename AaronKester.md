### First Project Proposal Idea

Provide a brief description to your project here. Imagine this as your time to "pitch" your idea to us and why it is _so cool_.

**What problem does your project solve?**

> Not knowing what is wrong with you >>> Now you know and you also know what to do about it!

**How will your project solve this problem?**

> Take in dates as the inputs.
> B-day and either the user will put in today's date, or it will automatically give today's.
> It will then pull from the numerology api and the app will focus on the "karma" and "soul" problems this user has.
> based on this information the output will be ways for this person to complete their karma. Give them the to-do list for being not so crummy

**What web APIs will it use?**

> Numerology API
> http://affinity-numerology.com/api/apiDocumentation.php

**What technologies will it use?**

> HTML
> JS
> Ajax
> CSS
